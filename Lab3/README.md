## Using Raspberry Pi 
* Raspberry pi already has python 2 and python 3 installed and it is reccomended to not update these installations
* It also has pip and pip3 installed 
* This means that we can get straight into running these python examples
* From the IOT repo lesson 3, I have copied in the examples that we are running in this lab into this repo
