# CPE 322-A Lab 1: GHDL and GTKWave

## Assignment Overview
The instructions for the lab were as follows:
* Go to the GitHub repository of Digital System Design (DSD)
  * Study VHDL and GHDL
* Go to the GHDL folder
  * Install GHDL and GTKWave
  * Run Half Adder Example
  * Run another example such as D Flip-Flop or 4-to-1 Multiplexer
  * Document results on your GitHub repository
* Exploration: [Icarus Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus_Verilog)


* GHDL is an open-source simulator for the VHDL language
* I found a website which explained VHDL very nicely since I was still confused about it when starting this lab
* I ran the half adder, full adder, D flip-flip, T flip-flop, 4-to-1 multiplexer, and 1-to-4 multiplexer and included the results from viewing them in GTKWAVE here

## What is VHDL?
From allaboutcircuits.com
> "VHDL is one of the commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDL) in digital circuit design. VHDL stands for VHSIC Hardware Description Language. In turn, VHSIC stands for Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit."

## Results
the first thing that I did after installing everything following the steps from Professor Lu's DSD repo was a hello world program
