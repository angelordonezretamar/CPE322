## Setting Up Raspberry Pi Again
* I am sad to say that I have not used my Pi very much since CPE 390
* One of the last things I did was set it up to mine a niche crypto called magicoin
* I believe that project may have screwed it up a bit so I set it up fresh following the IOT repo [Lesson One](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson1)
* After setting the Pi up again I followed the lab instructions listed above
