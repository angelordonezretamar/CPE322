## Setting Up Raspberry Pi Again
* I am sad to say that I have not used my Pi very much since CPE 390
* One of the last things I did was set it up to mine an obscure cryptocurrency called magicoin
* I believe that project may have screwed it up a bit so I set it up fresh following the IOT repo [Lesson One](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson1)
* I used the Tom's Hardware guide to setting up a "headless" pi so that I could try something new and set it up in a way I had not done before

It took some fiddling but after a couple of wipes of the sd card and retrying to connect through putty I finally got it

I also set up the VNC viwer to be able to use my pi completely from my laptop with no additional monitor, keyboard, or mouse

> fun fact, if you don't understand the references made in my pi login and hostname. These are names from Don Quijote, a great book by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes. My laptop is named Rocinante after Don Quijote's horse, so I named my pi Rucio after Sancho Panza's donkey.
