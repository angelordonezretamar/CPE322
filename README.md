# EE 322-A

* This is my repository for EE 322-A. This repository will include all of my notes from lectures, as well as all lab assignments.
* I will also be sure to add in all of my files from the project, whether it is done in a group or individually.
* I am looking forward to taking this class and leaning as much as I can.
