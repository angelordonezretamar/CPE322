## My Favorite Code Snippet
You'll never forget the first program you wrote
~~~CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
}
~~~

## My Favorite Quote
From Watchmen by Alan Moore
> "The disciplines of physical exercise, meditation and study aren't terribly esoteric. The means to attain a capability far beyond that of the so-called ordinary person are within the reach of everyone, if their desire and their will are strong enough. I have studied science, art, religion, and a hundred different philosophies. Anyone could do as much. By applying what you learn and ordering your thoughts in an intelligent manner it is possible to accomplish almost anything. Possible for an 'ordinary person.' There's a notion I'd like to see buried: the ordinary person. Ridiculous. There is no ordinary person." -Ozymandias
